:::caution[Important]
    
   If you click <img src="/img/icons/lock-icon.png" className="icon" alt="the Lock icon"/>, the following warning is displayed:
    
   ![Secure-Macro-Dialog](/img/Secure-Macro-Dialog.png)
   
   Secured macros cannot be unsecured, and their values cannot be edited. If you need to change the value of a secured macro, you must delete and readd it.
