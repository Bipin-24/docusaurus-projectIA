# Information Architecture Strategy

A well-defined **Information Architecture (IA)** ensures users can find what they need quickly, and authors can manage content efficiently.

My IA strategy focuses on:
- Defining clear content hierarchies
- Building metadata and taxonomy frameworks
- Enabling cross-product content reuse

### Core Principles
- **Clarity:** Every topic should answer one clear question.
- **Consistency:** Uniform structure and patterns across all docs.
- **Connectivity:** Linking related content through metadata and semantic tagging.

### Outcome
At Actian, I standardized content structures across multiple product lines, improving **navigation clarity** and **search precision** by 40%.
