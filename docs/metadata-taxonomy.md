# Metadata & Taxonomy Design

Metadata is the backbone of content findability.

I create metadata schemas that define:
- Product and version tagging
- Audience type
- Content type (Concept, Procedure, Reference)
- Status and lifecycle stage

### Deliverables
- Controlled vocabularies
- Tagging guidelines
- Taxonomy governance model

These ensure consistency across search and improve relevance in enterprise documentation portals.
