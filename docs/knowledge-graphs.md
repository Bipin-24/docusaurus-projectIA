# Knowledge Graphs in Documentation

Knowledge graphs connect content, context, and concepts.

I use them to:
- Visualize topic relationships
- Enable semantic search
- Power intelligent documentation assistants

Future vision: **A graph-based doc system** that dynamically links procedures, concepts, and references.
