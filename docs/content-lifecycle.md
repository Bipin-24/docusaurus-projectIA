# Content Lifecycle Management

I build lifecycle workflows from **draft → review → publish → retire**.

### Tools Used
- Git + Jenkins for automated builds
- Branch-based publishing for staging and production
- Review automation via pull requests

This ensures continuous content freshness and accuracy.
