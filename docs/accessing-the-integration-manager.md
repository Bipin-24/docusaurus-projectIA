# Accessing the Integration Manager

:::caution[Important]
    The first time you log in to Integration Manager as an administrator, you will use the default administrator login username and password (admin/admin). We strongly recommended that you change the admin password. Refer to [Editing Your Profile](./editing-your-profile).
:::

1. Navigate to the Integration Manager UI in your web browser:
   * Local Machine (and Docker): [http://localhost:8080/ui/](http://localhost:8080/ui/)
   * Actian DataCloud: [https://console.im.actiandatacloud.com/ui/](https://console.im.actiandatacloud.com/ui/)

3. On the Login page, do one of the following:
   * Enter your user credentials and click **LOGIN**. 
  
     :::note
     For on-prem installations, if you forgot your password, contact your administrator. If you are an on-prem administrator and forgot your password and no other admins have access to the on-prem stack, contact Actian support at support@actian.com for assistance with editing the database to reset your admin password.
