# IA Frameworks

I develop IA frameworks that scale across documentation sets and product lines.

### Examples of IA Models
- **Hub-and-Spoke:** A central hub page connecting topic clusters.
- **Task-Oriented:** Focused on user intent (Install → Configure → Use → Troubleshoot).
- **Topic-Based Authoring (DITA/Markdown):** Reusable modules for consistency.

### Tools & Methods
- Card sorting & content audits
- XML/DITA and Markdown-based structuring
- Automated sitemap generation using Python

These frameworks enable multi-product content reuse and seamless search integration.
