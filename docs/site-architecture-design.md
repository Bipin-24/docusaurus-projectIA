# Site Architecture Design

A good site structure balances simplicity and scalability.

### My Approach
- Define IA hierarchy using user journeys.
- Map topic relationships and dependencies.
- Apply card-based navigation for product and version-level documentation.

I introduced modern UI layouts and category landing pages that improved UX flow.
