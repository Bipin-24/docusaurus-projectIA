# Content Reuse Models

Reusability drives scalability.

I design modular content blocks using:
- **Component-based authoring (DITA/Markdown)**
- **Snippet management**
- **Conditional text and variables**

At Actian, we reduced content duplication by **35%** through reusable templates and shared component libraries.
