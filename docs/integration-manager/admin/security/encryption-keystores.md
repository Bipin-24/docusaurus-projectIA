# Encryption Keystores

An encryption keystore is required for the following:

* [HTTPS encryption](./enabling-https)
* [Encryption-at-rest](./encryption-at-rest)
* [Access token signatures](./access-token-signatures)
 
Each of these can share a single keystore or use their own keystores.

We recommended that you create your own keystore(s) rather than using the default keystore provided by Integration Manager.
