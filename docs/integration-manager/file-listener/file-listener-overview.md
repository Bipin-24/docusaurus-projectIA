# File Listener Services Overview

## Overview

Listener services are used to monitor file directories or cloud storage buckets/containers for new files.

When a new file appears that matches your include/exclude criteria, the associated listener submits the file to a Job Configuration in Integration Manager. The file will be available to the specified integration process using the $(LOCAL_JOB_SPEC_DIR) macro at runtime. For example, a file named Accounts.txt will be available as $(LOCAL_JOB_SPEC_DIR)Accounts.txt.

:::note
Camel DSL support supersedes and replaces the File Folder Listener support provided in versions prior to 3.2.

## Enabling File Listener Core Services

1. Locate your `application.properties` file:

   * Integration Manager: `<ProgramDataDirectory>\Actian\IntegrationManager\conf\application.properties`
   * Integration Agent: `<ProgramDataDirectory>\Actian\IntegrationAgent\conf\application.properties`

2. Add the following properties if they do not already exist:

    ```
    camel.springboot.auto-startup=true
    camel.springboot.routes-reload-enabled=true
    camel.springboot.routes-reload-directory=${sharedDataPath}/camel
    ```

3. Restart Integration Manager (or Integration Agent).
