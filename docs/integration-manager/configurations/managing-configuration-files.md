# Managing Configuration Files

You can upload files for use with your configurations. These can be public files or private files.

* **Private Files** can be created, edited, or deleted by the loggedâ€“in user. These files are visible to administrators.
* **Public Files** can be seen and accessed by any user. They can be created, edited, or deleted only by an administrator.
