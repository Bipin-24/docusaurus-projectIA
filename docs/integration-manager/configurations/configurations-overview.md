# Configurations Overview

A configuration is a set of properties and parameters that specify when, where, and how an integration will be executed. Configurations contain references to a specific integration, the location in which the integration will be executed, and the frequency at which executions will occur.

There a several ways to create integrations:
* [Creating Configurations Manually](./creating-configurations)
* [Importing Configurations](./importing-configurations)
* [Creating Configurations from a Template](./creating-configurations#creating-a-configuration-from-a-template)
* [Duplicating Configurations](./duplicating-configurations)
