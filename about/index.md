# About Me

Hi, I’m **Bipin Pandey** — an Information Architect, Content Strategist, and AI Documentation Leader with over 14 years of experience crafting intelligent, scalable content ecosystems.

My work bridges **Information Architecture**, **AI**, and **user experience** to build content systems that inform, engage, and adapt. I specialize in designing documentation structures that make complex products intuitive, measurable, and ready for the next era of intelligent content.

### 🧭 My Approach
- **Architect for clarity:** Every piece of information must serve a purpose and connect seamlessly within the ecosystem.  
- **Automate intelligently:** I use **AI, RAG frameworks, and LLMs** to automate metadata, tagging, and search optimization.  
- **Design for discoverability:** Good documentation is invisible—users find what they need before they even know they need it.  
- **Measure what matters:** I use analytics and SEO data to continuously refine the content strategy and user journey.
